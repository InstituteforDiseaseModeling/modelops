# Dask Workspace Configuration for ModelOps
# Usage: mops workspace up --config examples/workspace.yaml --env dev
#
# Note: Stack names are automatically generated based on environment
# Stack pattern: modelops-workspace-{env}
# Namespace pattern: modelops-dask-{env}
#
# Process vs Thread Configuration:
# - For simulation workloads (pure Python): Use processes=2, threads=1
# - For data science (NumPy/Pandas): Use processes=1, threads=4
# See docs/dask-configuration.md for detailed guidance
